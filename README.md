# ansible-videoprocessor
Ansible Role to set up a script to process recordings made with nginx-rtmp and email them out.

There is a chance this should just be merged into a build file and done away with as a seperate role as it is very specific to servers with a precise purpose and configuration.  Also possible at some point to replace with AWS processes instead (API, SNS, etc.)
